# family-tree-prolong
A simple Family Tree Program in Prolog that represents relationships between family members. Using the program, you will define family relationships and implement rules to query relationships such as parent, grandparent, sibling, and cousin relationships. This exercise allows you to explore logical inference and recursive queries within Prolog.
